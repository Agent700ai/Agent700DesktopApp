# Agent700 Desktop App Project Brief

## Project Overview
Agent700 Desktop App is a **security-first, privacy-focused** Electron-based desktop application that provides a trusted, feature-rich interface for interacting with the Agent700 AI platform. Built with privacy-by-design principles, it serves as a secure native desktop companion to the web-based Agent700 service, offering enhanced file processing capabilities, local data control, and enterprise-grade security features.

## Core Objectives (Security & Privacy First)
1. **Privacy-by-Design Architecture**: Implement zero-trust security model with local-first data processing and minimal data collection
2. **Secure Authentication & Session Management**: Advanced token security, secure storage, and session isolation
3. **Trusted File Processing**: Client-side processing with encrypted temporary storage and secure disposal
4. **Enterprise Security Compliance**: SOC2-ready security controls, audit logging, and compliance frameworks
5. **User Data Sovereignty**: Complete user control over conversation data with local storage and optional export
6. **Transparent Security Model**: Clear privacy policies, data handling transparency, and user consent mechanisms

## Key Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- User authentication with email/password via Agent700 API
- Agent browsing and selection with search functionality
- Real-time chat interface with markdown support
- File upload with OCR for images and document parsing for PDFs/DOCX
- Conversation history persistence per agent
- Chat reset and management capabilities

### Technical Requirements
- Cross-platform desktop application (Electron)
- Secure API communication with Bearer token authentication
- Local storage for conversation histories
- Integration with external libraries for file processing
- Responsive UI with modern web technologies

### Security Requirements (Enhanced)
- **Advanced Token Security**: Encrypted token storage, automatic expiration, and secure session isolation
- **Comprehensive Input Validation**: Multi-layer XSS prevention, SQL injection protection, and malicious content filtering
- **Secure File Processing**: Sandboxed file operations, encrypted temporary storage, and secure disposal
- **Zero-Trust Architecture**: Principle of least privilege, continuous verification, and network segmentation
- **Privacy Controls**: Data minimization, user consent management, and transparent data handling
- **Audit & Monitoring**: Comprehensive security logging, threat detection, and compliance reporting
- **Encryption Standards**: End-to-end encryption for sensitive data and secure communication protocols
- **Enterprise Compliance**: SOC2, GDPR, HIPAA-ready security controls and audit frameworks

## Success Criteria
- Seamless authentication and session management
- Smooth agent selection and chat experience
- Reliable file processing with accurate text extraction
- Persistent conversation histories across sessions
- Stable desktop application performance
- Intuitive user interface matching Agent700 design patterns

## Target Users (Security & Privacy Focused)
- **Enterprise Organizations**: Companies requiring secure, compliant AI interactions with sensitive data protection
- **Privacy-Conscious Professionals**: Users who prioritize data sovereignty and transparent privacy controls
- **Healthcare & Legal Sectors**: Organizations with strict compliance requirements (HIPAA, SOC2, GDPR)
- **Government & Defense**: Agencies requiring air-gapped or high-security AI processing capabilities
- **Financial Services**: Institutions needing secure document processing and confidential AI interactions
- **Research Organizations**: Academic and private research requiring secure intellectual property protection

## Project Scope
