# Product Context

## Why This Product Exists

The Agent700 Desktop App addresses the critical need for a **secure, privacy-first** native desktop interface to the Agent700 AI platform. In an era of increasing data breaches and privacy concerns, desktop applications offer essential security advantages over web-based interfaces:

3. **Secure File Processing**: Client-side processing ensures sensitive documents never leave the user's environment during analysis
4. **Trust & Transparency**: Clear privacy policies, open security model, and user consent mechanisms build organizational trust
5. **Air-Gapped Capabilities**: Enables secure AI interactions in high-security environments with limited internet connectivity
6. **Professional Compliance**: Seamlessly integrates into enterprise security frameworks and compliance workflows
